For the past few years, React has been my go-to framework for building web applications. It's powerful, widely adopted, and has an incredible ecosystem. But recently, I've found myself moving away from it for personal projects. Here's why.

## The Framework Fatigue

React isn't just React anymore. To build a modern React app, you need to understand a constellation of tools: **Webpack**, **Babel**, **ESLint**, **Prettier**, state management libraries, routing solutions, and more. The cognitive overhead became exhausting.

> "Sometimes the best tool is the one that gets out of your way."

I realized I was spending more time configuring build tools than actually building. For small projects, this felt like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

## Rediscovering Simplicity

I started experimenting with vanilla JavaScript and modern web APIs. The results were surprising:

- Faster initial load times
- No build step for simple projects
- Direct manipulation of the DOM felt liberating
- Smaller bundle sizes

Don't get me wrong — React is still incredible for *complex applications*. But for a personal blog, a portfolio site, or a simple tool? It felt like overkill.

### The Modern Web Platform

Browser APIs have evolved significantly. Features like `fetch()`, `async/await`, CSS Grid, and Web Components mean you can build sophisticated UIs without a framework. The platform itself has become powerful enough.

This portfolio you're reading? Built with minimal JavaScript, focusing on semantic HTML and progressive enhancement. It loads in milliseconds and works without JavaScript enabled.

## When React Still Makes Sense

I still reach for React when:

- Building large-scale applications with complex state
- Working with teams that have established React workflows
- Creating rich, interactive dashboards
- Needing the ecosystem and community support

The point isn't that React is bad. It's that **we should choose our tools deliberately**, not by default. Sometimes the best architecture is the simplest one that solves your problem.

For my personal projects, I'm embracing constraints. Less JavaScript, more HTML. Less abstraction, more directness. It's been refreshing.
