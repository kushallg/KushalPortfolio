I used to be a decent reader, especially nonfiction. As the new year started, I wanted to read more without pressuring myself with a number goal. On my list was *The Hidden Habits of Genius* by Craig Wright.

I picked it up thinking genius was this narrow thing. Math prodigies. Physics Nobel laureates. People who could solve differential equations in their sleep. Wright's first argument hit me hard: genius shows up in ways we don't even recognize. It's not just about being the smartest person in the room or having the highest IQ. There are artists who see the world differently, writers who capture human experience in ways that stick with you for decades, entrepreneurs who build things that seem impossible until they exist.

That realization stung because I spent all of high school chasing the wrong thing.

## The Mediocre Realization

I quickly realized I was mediocre in high school. Don't get me wrong, I did fine academically. Things came naturally to me, but I never actually tried my best or gave it my all. Looking back at that is frustrating. I desperately wanted to sway away from that path of mediocrity, and I thought the fact that I had realized I was mediocre made me somewhat better than someone truly mediocre living in bliss.

I was wrong about that too. Being aware you're mediocre doesn't make you less mediocre. It just makes you aware.

That's what gravitated me toward this book after my first semester of college. I met so many new people who drastically shaped my life and saw the real world for the first time. I yearned to be extraordinary. But I had no idea what extraordinary actually looked like outside of grades and test scores.

## What Wright Actually Says

Wright's whole thing is that geniuses share specific habits, and most of them aren't what you'd expect. The biggest one? They never stop learning. Elon Musk ran out of books to read at his local library as a kid. Einstein taught himself calculus. Marie Curie was reading advanced physics textbooks while working as a governess.

Before reading this book, I thought cultivating talent meant laser focus. Drop everything else. Practice one thing obsessively. That's how you compete with prodigies, right? I figured that would give me a chance to fight against the geniuses.

Wright argues the opposite. Geniuses are the most curious people in the room. They read widely, explore unrelated fields, ask stupid questions. They're comfortable looking like they don't know things because they actually want to learn.

I realized how wrong I was. I'd been trying to narrow everything down when I should have been expanding.

## The Target No One Else Can See

> "A person of talent hits a target that no one else can hit; a person of genius hits a target that no one else can see." — Arthur Schopenhauer

Wright uses this quote to explain how geniuses actually operate. They're not just better at solving known problems. They're asking different questions entirely.

Giving up at the sight of someone way better than you is the worst thing you could do. Recently, I've seen people who placed on the Putnam and yearned to be as talented and smart as them. But I never considered the work they might have put into it. While they were practicing math, I was playing video games or watching youtube.

Wright's argument goes deeper than just "work harder" though. It's about what kind of work. Geniuses don't just practice more. They learn across domains. They connect ideas that seem unrelated. They increase their surface area for serendipity.

The only way to escape mediocrity, as I understand it from Wright, is to surround yourself with ambitious people building things that seem impossible (e.g., startup hubs like New York or San Francisco, open source communities) and never stop expanding your knowledge. A Kindle subscription is about 10 bucks a month. If that's too much, use a public library or sail the seas. What's your excuse?

## The Sisyphus Parallel

This reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus, which I was really enamored by during high school because I felt that constant push toward improvement, only to feel like I was rolling the boulder back down every time I saw someone better. But Camus argued we must imagine Sisyphus happy. The struggle itself is the point. The work is the reward. You don't become extraordinary by reaching the top, you become extraordinary by choosing to keep pushing the boulder.

Wright would probably agree with Camus here. Genius isn't a destination. It's a habit of constant curiosity and learning, even when progress feels invisible.

## What You Should Actually Do

Instead of complaining to God or your parents about why you weren't born a genius or saying it's too late, do what Wright's research shows geniuses do: expand your curiosity. Increase your serendipity. Read things outside your field. Ask questions that make you look stupid. Be comfortable with boredom because that's where interesting thoughts happen.

Wright's last insight, the one I keep coming back to, is about maintaining childlike curiosity. Kids ask "why" about everything. They're not embarrassed to not know things. They explore without needing every exploration to be "productive." That's the habit worth building.

I'm glad I read this book sooner rather than later because I have my whole life ahead of me, although I wish I'd developed my inclination toward being extraordinary much earlier in life.



Here's what I'm taking from Wright:

**Genius is observed in different ways.** It might be different than what you think, so be kinder to others. (I'm struggling with this one.)

**Read, read, read.** There is only a finite amount of time on this planet. Make the most of it by learning everything the world has to offer.

**And the last and most important one: be a child.** Get comfortable with boredom and be as juvenile as you can when you're asking questions.
